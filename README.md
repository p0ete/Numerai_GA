# Deep learning optimized with Genetic Algorithm for the Numer.ai Tournament

## Synopsis

This is my first trial in the Numer.ai tournament. This is just for fun and doesn't give impressive results (yet).

I implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize the neural network architecture and hyper parameters.

## How-to

You need first to download "numerai_training_data.csv" and "numerai_tournament_data.csv" on the Numer.ai website.

(Optional) Augment the dataset:
> python augment_dataset.py 

Run the Genetic algorithm:
> python augment_dataset.py 

Clean the results folders:
> python augment_dataset.py 

## TODO List

- Need to otimize "augment_dataset.py", beacause it takes really too much time !!!
- Add comments in the code.
- Include different NN optimizers in the parameters of the genetic algorithm.
